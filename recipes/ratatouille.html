  <p>Enjoy this super-healthy classic French vegetarian dish, safe in the knowledge that it counts as four of your five-a-day</p>
  
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Fresh Tomatoes</li>
    <li>Eggplant</li>
    <li>Zuchini & Yellow Squash</li>
    <li>Bell Pepper</li>
    <li>Olive Oil</li>
    <li>Fresh Basil & Seasonings</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>How to make it?</h2>

  <p>
    1. Prep your veggies and preheat the oven.<br>
    2. Toss the eggplant with olive oil and salt on one baking sheet, and the squash and bell pepper on another baking sheet. Arrange the vegetables in an even layer. (Using two pans gives the vegetables room to breathe and lets us split the veggies by cook times.)<br>
    3. Bake both pans in the oven at once, stirring halfway. The eggplant will finish sooner than the other pan.<br>
    4. Meanwhile, make a simple tomato sauce on the stovetop. Stir the roasted vegetables into the simmering tomato sauce as theyâ€™re ready.<br>
    5. Lastly, add fresh basil and seasonings. Serve immediately, or let it cool to room temperature before refrigerating for later.
